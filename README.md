# Django Tutorial Mysite

This repo is for my personal practice of web application development with django. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

Django may not be a modern web framework that optimized for scalable I/O with asynchronous backends e,g, aiohttp and express, or the user-friendly SPA with javascript frontends e.g. React+Redux. However, it's powerful enough to elegantly create an MVP application with minimal coding to meet most of my requirements through daily works in data science.
